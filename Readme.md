# SML
## Superior Markup Language 

Invented and Created by Richard Kaufman (2016)

The brainchild of my colleague Richard , SML is supposed to supplant the way we build websites. Instead of an almagamation of several programming language and methodologies what if there was one language to rule them all. LUA was chosen to be that scripting language because of its powerful hashing properties. All that was left to do was build an interpreter that could render LUA script into a graphical user interface (GUI). The result was the SML binary. In the future it will be tweaked to fit inside of browsers as an addon, or as a built-in feature. At that point any sites hosted online with a ".sml" extension could be interpreted to have LUA script ready to be drawn as SML.

Until then we are going to test, improve, debug and build out the dream by attempting to build apps, and games that can prove out the potential of an SML website.
